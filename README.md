# INTERNAL DAYCARE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION
    For my third project at [FLATIRON SCHOOL](https://flatironschool.com/), I migrated an internal daycare management single-page application using a database using the create_table method available to me via ACTIVE RECORDS. You can also find the Active Records query methods use for receiving and sending information between the front and back end of this project.

    You can find the frontend via the frontend folder listed above. The backend is also listed above, but also can be found here [BACK-END](https://github.com/jarvistamara/phase-3-ruby-group-project-rack-react).

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
    I used the following programming languages:
    - REACT JSX (front-end framework)
    - JAVASCRIPT
    - CSS
    - RUBY
    - RACK
## HOW TO USE
    On start-up you will see a Home Page that describes the application. 
    There are two routes at the Navigation. One is the Home Page and the other allows you to view all of the current classrooms available management application. 
    
    On this page we can also CREATE new classrooms via the "Add New Classroom" button. Once clicked a form will appear in place of the button. If we instead want to view a specific classroom, we could click on any of the classroom listed on the Classroom's View. 
    
    Once click you will be shown the Teacher associated with the class, it's grade and a list of current students. Each student has the ability to be UPDATED and/or DELETED via the "Edit" or "Delete" button displayed. We can also create a new student for this classroom via the "Add New Student" button available. 
    
    Again, once click it will be replaced by the new student form which you can submit. All forms on this app updated the view automatically so there is no need to manually refresh the page.
